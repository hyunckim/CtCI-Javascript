 * we don't want to use extra space (so a map of nodes isn't an option) we first
 * need to figure out the different in depth of the two nodes. We then travel up
 * from the lower node, if there is one, so that we start at the same depth down
 * the path of each node. After we're at equal depths we just follow parent
 * pointers until we find a node that is common to both paths, that is the first
 * common ancestor.
